      <description>As a volleyball player and a coder, I have always found it annoying that there are no satisfying apps that take volleyball statistics, at least the ones that I have found. Like any sport, taking statistics in volleyball is important to make several in-game and post-game decisions. So in the pursuit of making stat-taking easier, I have made a java executable that takes hitting efficiency statistics.
In volleyball, hitting efficiency is the (kill count - error count) divided by the total attempts and finally multiplied by a thousand.</description>

      <description>Hello and welcome to my personal blog! I plan to use this blog and website to document any future projects that I may have. I tend to participate in a lot of robotics and coding competitions as well as personal projects, so I thought to myself, why not make a blog about it?
No there will be no tutorials of any sort but feel free to contact me for any questions and or suggestions.</description>
