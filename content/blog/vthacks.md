I just finished my first Hackathon! Drank a lot of Monsters, cried a little bit, looked at endless stack-overflow discussion pages, and most importantly I made some hacker friends and had a lot of fun. It was a safe environment to nerd out to the max. I learned a lot more about JavaScript, CSS, Microsoft cognitive services, and WebRTC.
