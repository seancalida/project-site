As a volleyball player and a coder, I have always found it annoying that there are no satisfying apps that take volleyball statistics, at least the ones that I have found. Like any sport, taking statistics in volleyball is important to make several in-game and post-game decisions. So in the pursuit of making stat-taking easier, I have made a java executable that takes hitting efficiency statistics.

*In volleyball, hitting efficiency is the (kill count - error count) divided by the total attempts and finally multiplied by a thousand.*

**Requirements:**

* User must be able to input up to 6 hitters
* User interface must be easy enough to follow the game
* User must be able to add kills, errors, and attempts
* User must be able to view stats mid-game (time outs) and post-game
* Statistics must display kills, errors, attempts, and hitting efficiency

As of now, this is just a java executable in my laptop. If I decide to, this may serve as a proof of concept to develop a simple mobile app. :)
