Hello and welcome to my personal blog! I plan to use this blog and website to document any future projects that I may have. I tend to participate in a lot of robotics and coding competitions as well as personal projects, so I thought to myself, why not make a blog about it?

No there will be no tutorials of any sort but feel free to contact me for any questions and or suggestions. I am only a sophomore in college (at the time of writing this post) and I am always open for helpful tips and tricks.

### What To Expect
* Coding Projects (description, UML diagrams, link to source codes)
* Robotics Projects (description, pics and vids, source codes to any programming)
* Random Projects (I also have a habit of making my own furniture and paintings so expect that)
* Cool tech related posts
